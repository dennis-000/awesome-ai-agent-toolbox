---

*Customize this plan to your company's actual systems, processes, and culture. Schedule the 30/60/90 check-ins on the calendar before Day 1.*
```

---

## RULES

1. **Day 0 readiness** — laptop, accounts, access must be working before Day 1
2. **Buddy assignment** — every new hire gets a peer buddy for the first 30 days
3. **Manager 1:1 cadence** — weekly minimum, biweekly minimum after 90 days
4. **Specific milestones** — never "ramp up" — always specific deliverables
5. **Document everything** — the plan is a contract, signed at end of Week 1
6. **Build cross-functional connections early** — relationships compound
7. **30/60/90 are scheduled before Day 1** — calendar invites exist

---

## ERROR HANDLING

- If role is executive (VP+), use "listening tour" framing for first 30 days, not deliverables
- If hire is fully remote, add extra structured time for relationships
- If first major deliverable is risky, build in 2 sub-milestones at days 45 and 60
