## Routing Logic

When the user invokes `/recruit <command>`, route to the appropriate sub-skill.

### Full Role Analysis (`/recruit analyze <role>`)
This is the flagship command. It launches **5 parallel subagents** simultaneously:

1. **recruit-job** agent → Job description quality, ATS optimization, inclusivity, keyword density
2. **recruit-screen** agent → Resume screening framework, must-have vs nice-to-have, red flags
3. **recruit-interview** agent → Interview structure, behavioral and technical questions, scoring rubric
4. **recruit-salary** agent → Market salary range, geographic adjustments, total comp benchmarks
5. **recruit-employer** agent → Employer brand competitiveness, candidate experience, retention signals

**Scoring Methodology (Hiring Readiness Score 0-100):**
| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Job Description Quality | 20% | Clarity, inclusivity, ATS optimization, candidate appeal |
| Screening Process | 20% | Resume screening rigor, must-have alignment, red flag detection |
| Interview Framework | 20% | Question quality, structure, scoring rubric, time-to-decision |
| Compensation Competitiveness | 20% | Market alignment, total comp, geographic accuracy |
| Employer Brand Strength | 20% | Glassdoor signals, Indeed reviews, retention indicators |

**Composite Hiring Readiness Score** = Weighted average of all 5 categories

**Hiring Grade & Signal:**
| Score | Grade | Signal |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 85-100 | A+ | Ready to hire — process is dialed in |
| 70-84 | A | Strong — minor refinements needed |
| 55-69 | B | Average — significant improvements possible |
| 40-54 | C | Below Average — losing top candidates |
| 25-39 | D | Poor — failed hires likely |
| 0-24 | F | Critical — overhaul process before hiring |

### Quick Snapshot (`/recruit quick <role>`)
Fast 60-second role assessment. Do NOT launch subagents. Instead:
1. Ask user for: role title, location, salary range, seniority level
2. Evaluate: market demand, expected time-to-hire, candidate competition, salary alignment
3. Output a quick scorecard with hiring difficulty rating and top 3 priorities
4. Keep output under 40 lines

### Individual Commands
For all other commands, route to the corresponding sub-skill.

## Role Type Detection

Before running any analysis, detect the role type:
- **Technical/Engineering** → Focus on: technical screening, coding assessment, GitHub review, take-home vs live coding
- **Sales** → Focus on: track record verification, quota attainment, references, ride-along simulation
- **Executive (VP+)** → Focus on: executive search, confidential outreach, board references, transition planning
- **Creative (Design/Marketing)** → Focus on: portfolio review, taste assessment, brand fit, work samples
- **Operations/Admin** → Focus on: process fluency, software proficiency, attention to detail, references
- **Customer Service/Support** → Focus on: communication, empathy, role-play scenarios, tone analysis
- **Healthcare/Legal/Regulated** → Focus on: license verification, certification check, compliance background

## Output Standards

All outputs must follow these rules:
1. **Bias-aware** — Avoid age, gender, ethnicity, or other protected class language
2. **Legal compliance** — Stay within EEOC guidelines, avoid prohibited questions
3. **Data-driven** — Reference actual salary data and market signals
4. **Candidate-respectful** — Treat candidates as humans, not transactions
5. **Time-efficient** — Recommendations should reduce time-to-hire
6. **Client-ready** — Reports should be presentable to hiring managers without editing

## File Output

All markdown outputs saved to the current working directory.
PDF reports generated via `Bash(python3 ~/.claude/skills/recruit/scripts/generate_recruit_pdf.py)`.

**Important:** Recruiters charge $15,000-$30,000 per placement. This tool produces the analysis and documentation that justifies that fee.
